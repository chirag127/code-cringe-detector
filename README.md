# Code Cringe Detector

> _"Because your code deserves a reality check with a side of sass."_

Code Cringe Detector is a VS Code extension that helps you write cleaner code by detecting bad practices and code smells using a humorous, sarcastic tone ‚Äî making refactoring more engaging and fun.

Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite AI model, it provides intelligent code analysis with a personality.

## Features

### üîç AI-Powered Code Analysis

Detects common code smells and bad practices including:

-   Long functions ("300 lines? Is this a function or a novel?")
-   Vague variable names ("'x'? Seriously? This isn't algebra class.")
-   Excessive nesting ("Inception called, they want their dream levels back.")
-   Lack of comments ("Silent code is mysterious, but not in a good way.")
-   Duplicate code ("Copy-paste is not a design pattern.")

### üí¨ Sassy Feedback

Receive feedback with personality - making code reviews less boring and more memorable.

### üéØ Inline Decorations

Highlights problematic code directly in your editor with hover text explaining the issue.

### üìä Sidebar Panel

View all detected issues in one place with the ability to jump directly to the problematic code.

### üîß Fix Suggestions

Get AI-powered suggestions to fix the detected issues with a single click.

### üìú History Log

Track your progress with a history of past scans - see how your code quality improves over time.
